UPDATE 2023: I am freezing this, as Im not using it.   One needs a test tool per language; one that allows fast test creation.

punit
=====

*perl*, unit-test builder, similar to phpunit-skelgen

At point of writing this, the code contains no javadoc, however I am scribbling notes at owenberesford.me.uk/resource/punit

This is written in objects, and so may be linked/use'd in normal fashion.
There are CLI interfaces, which is how I guess most people would use this.

I will import into CPAN when the entire thing is completed.
